                        <p>Hello and welcome! Thank you for visiting my website! I'll start with how I found the indie web. I was looking at my youtube recommendeds and found a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUgOT22F5s">"A Web Revival: the Internet didn't die, you're just not on it"</a>. Watching the video got me interested so I checked the posters website called <a href="https://onio.club/">Onio club.</a> Talking in the chat and seeing so many people be inspired to make their own websites got me motivated and so here I am!</p>
                        <p>Now to talk about me. I'm a Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro and I really like listening to new music, reading and playing videogames (my pc is really bad though so I'm a bit limited). I've always been interested in webdevelopment, programming and tech in general. I've tried to learn programming 4 different times, the first one was trying to make a videogame but I ended up losing motivation, the second time was a repeat, the third time I got further learning python and machine learning but I ended up giving up too.</p>
                        <p>Over time I noticed I kept on giving up because while I REALLY liked the idea of programming, having no actual reason and wanting a career totally unrelated to it made me eventualy stop to focus on other things. But I've been sick of Instagram and other social media for a very, very long time. My feed kept bouncing between depressing and funny but it wasn't doing me good, so when I saw that video, saw the community around the indie web and the opportunity to finally learn something I've always wanted and put it to use motivated me to push on, and I'm glad I did!</p>
                        <p>This about me is still a work in progress, and will always be because who I am now is not the same as who I'll be tomorrow*</p>
                        <p class="small_legend">*This page is incomplete now though, I'm still writing a better about me.</p>
